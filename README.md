# 🍁 @akistack Monorepo Starter

<!-- Replace the description below with your own description of this monorepo.  -->

Welcome to the Rush monorepo template provided by `@akistack`. This template helps you create a new monorepo that integrates our recommended standards and solutions with less effort.

> Note: This README is for developers. If you want to know how to create monorepo from this template, please refer to [Maintainer's Guide](docs/devops/maintainers-guide.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 22 LTS, We recommend using [fnm](https://fnm.vercel.app) to manage Node.js versions)
* [Rush.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/rush) (Install: `npm i -g @microsoft/rush`)

## Getting Started

### Clone Repository

<!-- Replace the following Git address with your own repo. -->

```shell
git clone git@github.com:akistack/monorepo-starter.git
cd monorepo-starter
```

### Install or Update Dependencies

> This repository use [Rush](https://rushjs.io) and PNPM to manage dependencies. 
> If you are not familiar with Rush.js, refer to the [Rush.js docs](https://rushjs.io/pages/developer/new_developer/) for more details.


```shell
## Installing dependencies
rush install

## Updating dependencies and shrinkwrap file
rush update
```

> Use `rush install` for installing from the existing lockfile.
> 
> Use `rush update` when you change any `package.json` to refresh the lockfile.

### Build a Project and/or Its Dependencies

```shell
## Building all dependencies of project `foo` except itself
rush build -T foo   # equivalent to `rush build --to-except foo`

## Building a project `foo` and its dependencies
rush build -t foo   # equivalent to `rush build --to foo`

## Building all projects
rush build
```

### Project Scripts (rushx)

When you need to run scripts for a specific project, use `rushx` from that project's folder:

```shell
cd apps/web/app-web-example
rushx dev
```

### Daily Commands

```shell
## Run unit tests for projects
rush test
rush test:coverage    # with coverage

## Run type checking and linting
rush typecheck
rush lint
rush lint:fix

## Run E2E testing
rush e2e
```

### Initializing a New Project

Run `rush init-project` and select a template. Then fill the form with package name, author, project path, etc.

After completion, run `rush update` to install dependencies and update the shrinkwrap file.
